## Description
This project aims to simplify the process of splitting bills, such as when dining out with friends at a restaurant.  All you have to do is to input the **payment amount**, the number of **people** and the **tip** you want to give, that’s it! 
I used JS, HTML and CSS here. Additionally, I've incorporated interesting functions like ‘*parseInt()*’ and ‘*parseFloat()*’.
