## Description
This project aims to simplify the process of splitting bills, such as when dining out with friends at a restaurant.  All you have to do is to input the **payment amount**, the number of **people** and the **tip** you want to give, that’s it! 
I used JS, HTML and CSS here. Additionally, I've incorporated interesting functions like ‘*parseInt()*’ and ‘*parseFloat()*’.

## Usage 

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wikaobl/billsplitter
```

Next, install dependencies

```bash
cd billsplitter
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run
```

After successfully starting the project, open your web browser and go to the specifiedg URL http://localhost:3000
